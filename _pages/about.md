Hi! I'm Sullam! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. 

I'm broadly interested in the safety of language models. Specifically, my work focuses on identifying and mitigating harms, such as bias and stereotypes, encoded in LLMs. I'm also enthusiastic about leveraging LLMs in social sciences, bridging the gaps between language models and the insights from cognitive science and psychology.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
